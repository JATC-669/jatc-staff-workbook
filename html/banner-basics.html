                            <li>Comments: ALWAYS check the comments if interaction directly with an apprentice or dealing with some sort of anomaly. Always leave a comment if making any kind of change that we might need to know when or why it occurec (you'll learn what constitutes that type of change as you go.)</li>
                            <li>Reports: Most student-specific, automatically-generated printed matter can be created in ths tab, including scantrons and welcome letters</li>
                            <li>Orders: Most orders are placed when enrolling students. But if they lose their materials or we have some other reason to order a book, it can be done here. </li>
                            <li>Enrollment History: Good to see an apprentice's oldest course if the Enrollment tab is a bit confusing. This lists the courses in order of when they were enrolled by date</li>
